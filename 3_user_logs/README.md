This is the third dataset analysed by me After passing Google Data Analytics Certificate in May 2022.   


User Logs -- analising customers data. Finding the most popular platform and the most active users. Visualizing data with Seaborn distplot, barplot and countplot methods.       

 


Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
