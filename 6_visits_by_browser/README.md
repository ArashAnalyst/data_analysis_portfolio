This is the sixth dataset analysed by me After passing Google Data Analytics Certificate in April 2022.   


Visits by Browser -- analising web-site visits. Defining proportion of real users and visits by bots. Findig the most popular browser for users and for bots. Barplotting results, downloading data using **Google Docs API** and merging it to our dataframe. Read_csv, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, pivot, fillna, assign and merge methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis. 



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
