This is the fourth dataset analysed by me After passing Google Data Analytics Certificate in April 2022.   


Ads Campaign -- Plotting data in logarithmic scale to find the type of data distribution, finding ad_id with an anomalistict number of views. Comparing average and simple moving average views data. Categorizing clients' registration data and labelling it. Plotting results with help of interactive Plotly plot.    



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
