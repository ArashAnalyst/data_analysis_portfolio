This is the dataset analysed by me After passing Google Data Analytics Certificate in May 2022.   

Analising NYC taxi orders with Pandas. Read_csv, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.  
 

Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding, data analytics and SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
